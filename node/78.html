But those images are much less straightforward than they may seem to a layperson: each one is the result of a complicated set of decisions and processes involving the large team behind the Rovers.<br />
            With Seeing Like a Rover, Janet Vertesi takes us behind the scenes to reveal the work that goes into creating our knowledge of Mars. Every photograph that the Rovers take, she shows, must be processed, manipulated, and interpretedâand all that comes after team members negotiate with each other about what they should even be taking photographs of in the first place. Vertesiâs account of the inspiringly successful Rover project reveals science in action, a world where digital processing reveals scientific truths, where images are used to craft consensus, and where team members develop an uncanny intimacy with the sensory apparatus of a robot that is millions of miles away. Ultimately, Vertesi shows, every image taken by the Mars Rovers is not merely a picture of Marsâitâs a portrait of the whole Rover team, as well.<br />

This volume revisits the topic of a classic text published in 1990, taking into account both the changing conceptual landscape of STS and the emergence of new imaging technologies in scientific practice. It offers cutting-edge research on a broad array of fields that study information as well as short reflections on the evolution of the field by leading scholars, including some of the contributors to the 1990 volume. The essays consider the ways in which viewing experiences are crafted in the digital era; the embodied nature of work with digital technologies; the constitutive role of materials and technologiesâfrom chalkboards to brain scansâin the production of new scientific knowledge; the metaphors and images mobilized by communities of practice; and the status and significance of scientific imagery in professional and popular culture. </p>

Drawing upon three years of fieldwork with the Mars Rover team including ethnography, participant observation, and interviews, the dissertation contributes to the literature in Science &amp; Technology Studies by advancing the analytical framework of drawing as: a practical corollary to Wittgenstein and Hansonâs concepts of seeing as that allows the analyst to explore the work of producing scientific images that draw natural objects as analytical objects to enable future representations and interactions. Further, images of Mars betray the social organization of the mission team and its commitment to consensus operations. Observing how images of Mars are drawn as trustworthy documents, drawn as a hypothesis or as a record of collective agreement, drawn as a map for the Rover and drawn as a public space, the disertation demonstrates how interactions with and around Mars Rover images support this political orientation, making the Roverâs body a body politic.</p>

  <span class="views-field views-field-body">        <span class="field-content"><p>This article introduces the concept of the sociotechnical projectory to explore the importance of future-oriented discourse in technical practice. It examines the case of two flagship NASA missions that, since the 1960s, have been continually proposed and deferred. Despite the missions never being flown, it argues that they produced powerful effects within the planetary science community as assumed âend-pointsâ to which all current technological, scientific, and community efforts are directed. It asserts that attention to the social construction of technological systems requires historical attention to how actors situate themselves with respect to a shared narrative of the future.</p>

In this article, I develop the analytical vocabulary of âseamsâ for studying heterogeneous, multi-infrastructural environments. Drawing upon six years of ethnographic fieldwork with two distributed science teams, as well as studies in Ubiquitous Computing, I examine overlaps among infrastructures and how actors work creatively with and across their seams. Rather than suggesting that actors are hemmed in or incapacitated by multiple infrastructural commitments, inclusions, and exclusions, I show instead how they work artfully to align them in ways concordant with membership and how this produces both consequences for their work and opportunities for analysis. </p>

Building on prior work in Science and Technology Studies on the importance of embodiment to visualization, the paper posits that such practices also contribute to the production and maintenance of social order within the organizational context of the laboratory. It thus places visualization technologies and techniques in the context of the social organization of scientific work, contributing to our understanding of representation in scientific practice.</p>

In the face of diverse configurations of systems, users, and designers, we suggest that designers treat their practice less as an expression of enduring or user-specific 'values,' and more as a series of decisions about the ethical distribution of control and responsibility within systems.</p>

We draw on ethnographic work with two robotic space exploration teams to show how each community's norms of "data-sharing" are best understood as arising not from the context of the use or exchange of data, but from the context of data production. Shifting our perspective back to the point of production suggests that digital artifacts are embedded in a broader data economy. We present implications for analysis of data in interactional context, and for introducing systems or policies that conflict with the value of data in its context of production.</p>

In particular, we focus on transnational practices: that is, seeing technology use beyond a single country or culture, but as evolving in relation to global processes, boundary crossings, frictions and hybrid practices. In doing so, we expand upon existing research in HCI to consider the effects, implications for individuals and communities, and design opportunities in times of increased transnational interactions. We hope to broaden the conversation around the impact of technology in global processes by bringing together scholars from HCI and from related humanities, media arts and social sciences disciplines.</p>

Seen thus, the images promote a crafted vision of Heveliusâs astronomical practice and skills, constituting a careful self-presentation to his dis- tant professional network and a claim as to which instrumental techniques guarantee accurate observations. Reviewing the reception of the images, the article explores how visual rhetoric may be invoked and challenged in the context of controversy, and suggests renewed analytical attention to the role of laboratory imagery in instrumental cultures in the history of science.</p>

  <span class="views-field views-field-body">        <span class="field-content"><p>This paper explores the effects of iconic, abstract representations of complex objects on our interactions with those objects through an ethnographic study of the use of the London Underground Map to tame and enframe the city of London. Official reports insist that the `Tube Map's' iconic status is due to its exemplary design principles or its utility for journey planning underground. This paper, however, presents results that suggest a different role for the familiar image: one of an essential visual technology that stands as an interface between the city and its user, presenting and structuring the points of access and possibilities for interaction within the urban space. The analysis explores the public understanding of an inscription in the world beyond the laboratory bench, the indexicality of the immutable mobile's visual language, and the relationship between representing and intervening. It further suggests fruitful crossovers between Science Studies, Urban Studies, and HumanâComputer Interaction by approaching the individual as a `user' of a city and its graphical interface, applying the technique of cognitive mapping to overlapping virtual and analog spaces, and exploring the social and practical effects of strong and standardized visual languages on further narratives and interactions with scientific, technological, or everyday objects. </p>

Although Heveliusâs Selenographia (1647) was applauded for its many detailed, self-engraved pictures of the moon, his cartography and proposed nomenclature were supplanted by Riccioliâs as offered in Almagestum novum (1651), in spite of the latterâs simplistic pictures and promotion of geocentric cosmology. Exploring this paradox through pictorial analysis, three types of images common to both Selenographia and Almagestum novum are compared, employing an analytical tool developed by Svetlana Alpers in The art of describing (1983). A focus on this debate exposes the tensions evoked by new technologies of vision and competing cultures of visual epistemology in seventeenth-century astronomy. As both selenographers grappled with questions about the role of representation and what kinds of knowledge could be generated visually, the successes and failures of their competing projects present implications for the course of visual astronomy, as well as for our understanding of the use of âvisual technologiesâ in a period of controversy.</p>

  <h3><p>Intercultural Probes as a method for reflective HCI. Paper for CHI 2006 workshop, "Reflective HCI."</p>
</h3>
  <div class="views-row views-row-1 views-row-odd views-row-first views-row-last">
      
  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>This position paper suggests that a discussion of the research agenda for Reflective HCI should include articulating and compiling those practices and methods which might characterize this approach, and which can be made available to HCI specialists and design professionals so as to integrate reflective strategies into their everyday practice in both research and industrial settings. The paper briefly discusses the case study of the Intercultural Probe, a version of Gaver et al.âs Cultural Probe [9], a method designed to bring the designerâs own values to the fore by placing them in context amongst those of the identified target users, thus incorporating critical reflection methodologically into the design process. Intercultural Probes may be an example of a reflective design practice in HCI which can be applied or adapted to a number of research contexts, introducing a reflective component to other designers and furthering the agenda of Reflective HCI.</p>

  <h3><p>Light and Enlightenment in Joseph Wright of Derby's The Alchymist. MPhil thesis, University of Cambridge Dept of History and Philosophy of Science, 2002.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>This essay proposes a new analysis of The Alchymist by addressing three questions: âWho is enlightened, by what, and why?â The analysis will begin with a focussed discussion of the paintingâs peculiar treatment of its subject in the context of the history of chemistry, where it plays with sensitive ideas of historicity, theory and practice, and discovery. We will then move to answer the question of what kind of enlightenment the alchemist is experiencing, derived from a close reading of the paintingâs symbolism and composition with respect to Wrightâs use of light in the piece. Finally, we will situate the painting within Wrightâs own position with respect to the Lunar Society and the Royal Academy, gleaning a role for the provincial or fringe practitioner with their artisanal knowledge with respect to both chemistry and painting.</p>

  <div class="views-field views-field-body">        <div class="field-content"><p>While planetary spacecraft are unmanned, the missions are manned, and must be understood in that way. This requires the addition of the social sciences to the science and engineering disciplines that develop them. In this White Paper, we argue that alongside scientific and technical considerations, the Planetary Science Decadal Survey should require that missions incorporate deeper consideration of the social science of spacecraft operations to maximize their missionsâ scientific, technical and fiscal success. After all, each missionâs unique configuration of human interactions, relationships and roles lends it a different culture â a âstyleâ or âpersonalityââ that affects how the mission proceeds, how goals are met, and how science is done.</p>
